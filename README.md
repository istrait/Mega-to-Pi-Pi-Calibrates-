# Mega-to-Pi-Pi-Calibrates-

This is a collaborative effort between myself, members of the Alma College Dow Digital Science Center, and members of the Alma College Technology Staff.

This project takes Vernier sensor data from a Arduino Mega, passes it via serial over USB to a Raspberry Pi that does the calibration calculations using data from a file named calibrations.csv, then passes the data to a cloud based server.

As it is written now, it will (using my www folder) upload the data to the Alma College Mohawk data server.  This requires a file that is not available on github.

More information to come.
